          Music is arguably the backbone of every presentation, and choosing the
          right track can make or break any scene. Under the strict guidance of
          industry veterans, I learned the ins and outs of live event scoring,
          producing audio for theme setters, providing exhilarating beats to
          hype up crowds, and giving unforgettable moments for awardees through
          soaring scores.

          Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.
          It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It
          contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS
          ACTION WAIVER. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and
          disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or
          service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or
          in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
          individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless
          otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
          English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company,
          and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors
          in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
          unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided
          under the Terms. Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.
          Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to
          the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and
          basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to
          the Company should be sent to: Manila, NCR. After the Notice is
          received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or
          dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or
          dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either
          party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any
          settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the
          arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the
          award to which either party is entitled. Arbitration Rules.
          Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration
          Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider
          that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not
          available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
          alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern
          all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in
          conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing
          the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA
          at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single,
          neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of
          the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
          $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based
          arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or
          disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand
          U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be
          determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a
          location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside
          of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you
          reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties
          reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings.
          Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in
          any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an
          award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company
          made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will
          pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear
          its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and
          shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
          Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If
          non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be
          conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
          submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
          initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any
          personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
          agreed by the parties.

          If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within
          thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin
          an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by
          any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
          arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either
          party is entitled. Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated
          through the American Arbitration Association, an established
          alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set
          forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the
          parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules
          of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except
          to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA
          Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available
          online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
          arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any
          claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
          than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
          binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
          seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
          award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
          right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any
          hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence,
          unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties
          agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
          shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place
          of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
          the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
          settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation
          of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
          $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements
          arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the
          fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Additional Rules for
          Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration
          is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online
          and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall
          be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration
          shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
          unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

          If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within
          thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin
          an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by
          any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
          arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either
          party is entitled. Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated
          through the American Arbitration Association, an established
          alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set
          forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the
          parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules
          of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except
          to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA
          Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available
          online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
          arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any
          claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
          than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
          binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
          seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
          award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
          right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any
          hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence,
          unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties
          agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
          shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place
          of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
          the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
          settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation
          of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
          $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements
          arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the
          fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Additional Rules for
          Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration
          is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online
          and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall
          be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration
          shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
          unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

          Time Limits. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the
          arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
          statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
          Rules for the pertinent claim. Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration
          is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of
          you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any
          other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
          arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of
          all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
          award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
          available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and
          the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
          decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
          the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
          relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
          have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
          the Company. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
          CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN
          FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and
          disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Right
          to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this
          Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the
          claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
          portion of this Arbitration Agreement. Survival of Agreement. This
          Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
          relationship with Company. Small Claims Court. Nonetheless the
          foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in
          small claims court. Emergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing,
          either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
          federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.
          A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any
          other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.

          If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within
          thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin
          an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by
          any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
          arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either
          party is entitled. Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated
          through the American Arbitration Association, an established
          alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set
          forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the
          parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules
          of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except
          to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA
          Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available
          online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
          arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any
          claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
          than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
          binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
          seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
          award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
          right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any
          hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence,
          unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties
          agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
          shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place
          of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
          the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
          settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation
          of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
          $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements
          arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the
          fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Additional Rules for
          Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration
          is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online
          and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall
          be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration
          shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
          unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

          If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within
          thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin
          an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by
          any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
          arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either
          party is entitled. Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated
          through the American Arbitration Association, an established
          alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set
          forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the
          parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules
          of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except
          to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA
          Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available
          online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
          arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any
          claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
          than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
          binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
          seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
          award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
          right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any
          hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence,
          unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties
          agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
          shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place
          of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
          the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
          settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation
          of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
          $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements
          arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the
          fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Additional Rules for
          Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration
          is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online
          and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall
          be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration
          shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
          unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

          Time Limits. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the
          arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
          statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
          Rules for the pertinent claim. Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration
          is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of
          you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any
          other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
          arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of
          all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
          award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
          available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and
          the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
          decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
          the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
          relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
          have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
          the Company. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
          CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN
          FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and
          disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Right
          to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this
          Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the
          claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
          portion of this Arbitration Agreement. Survival of Agreement. This
          Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
          relationship with Company. Small Claims Court. Nonetheless the
          foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in
          small claims court. Emergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing,
          either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
          federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.
          A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any
          other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.

          If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within
          thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin
          an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by
          any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
          arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either
          party is entitled. Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated
          through the American Arbitration Association, an established
          alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set
          forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the
          parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules
          of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except
          to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA
          Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available
          online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
          arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any
          claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
          than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
          binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
          seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
          award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
          right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any
          hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence,
          unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties
          agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
          shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place
          of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
          arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
          the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
          settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation
          of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
          $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements
          arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the
          fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Additional Rules for
          Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration
          is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online
          and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall
          be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration
          shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
          unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

          arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
          statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
          Rules for the pertinent claim. Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration
          is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of
          you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any
          other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
          arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of
          all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
          award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
          available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and
          the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
          decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which

          have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and

          disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Right

          Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the
          claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
          portion of this Arbitration Agreement. Survival of Agreement. This
          Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
          relationship with Company. Small Claims Court. Nonetheless the
          foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in
          small claims court. Emergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing,
          either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
          federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.
          A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any
          other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
